## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Divya - Git repo , Slack , Online resources , Communication
Strong communication. Being able to communicate when they're having trouble understanding a logic or needing help. 


## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We would love to attempt to mix up coding together and also working independently as we know our schedules won't 100% match. We'll use slack and VSCode Liveshare.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
We are first going through the README separately.Walking through each wave together and write psuedocode and dicide the waves to work independantly and get back and work together.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Being directly and honest with each other coming from a positive space. 


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Trying to find ways to code together rather than independently finishing the wave and then reviewing so we can share logics in the moment. 


## Optional: Other agreements
